## Development

```
$ npm run dev
```

This command will start a dev server that provides both the static files and serves as the API.

The game submission result is randomized and nothing is sent to the real database by default.

All project files are watched for changes and the server will restart as required. Refresh the page to see the most recent changes.

## Deployment

The project is hosted on Firebase and is deployed using GitHub actions. Changes pushed to the remote's main branch will be deployed automatically.
